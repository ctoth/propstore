# Argumentative Large Language Models for Explainable and Contestable Claim Verification

## One-Sentence Summary
This paper presents ArgLLMs, a method that uses LLMs to generate pro/con arguments with confidence scores, constructs Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks (QBAFs), and applies DF-QuAD gradual semantics to produce explainable and contestable claim verification verdicts. *(p.0)*

## Problem Addressed
LLMs have extensive knowledge and can apply it to claim verification, but they are limited by: (1) inability to fully explain their reasoning in a way that reflects their "reasoning" and knowledge, (2) lack of contestability -- no mechanism for external agents to reliably challenge or override LLM judgments. Current approaches either use LLMs as black boxes or extract symbolic representations without grounded argumentation. *(p.0, p.2)*

## Key Contributions
- **ArgLLMs**: A method for using LLMs to generate arguments (pro/con) with confidence scores that are structured into QBAFs *(p.0)*
- **Explainability via argumentation**: QBAFs serve as the basis for formal explanations of claim verdicts *(p.0)*
- **Contestability**: Humans can override LLM-generated argument strengths, add/remove arguments, and the framework formally propagates these changes *(p.0, p.6)*
- **Novel properties**: Formal proofs that DF-QuAD satisfies base score monotonicity and argument relation contestability *(p.6-7, p.17-18)*
- **Competitive performance**: ArgLLMs match or exceed state-of-the-art on claim verification tasks (TruthfulQA, StrategyQA) while providing transparency *(p.5-6)*

## Methodology

### Pipeline Overview (Figure 2, p.2)

The ArgLLMs pipeline has these stages:

1. **Claim Input**: A claim to verify, optionally with contextual information *(p.2)*
2. **LLM Argument Generation**: The LLM generates supporting and attacking arguments for the claim *(p.2)*
   - Uses one of several prompt strategies: Direct Questioning, Chain-of-Thought, or role-player prompts (ChatGPT, OPRO, analyst, debater) *(p.10-12)*
3. **LLM Uncertainty Estimation**: The LLM assigns confidence/strength scores to each argument *(p.2)*
   - Base strength τ(a) assigned to each argument a
   - Two approaches: (a) 0.5 fixed base for arguments + LLM estimates argument strength, or (b) LLM estimates base score directly *(p.5)*
4. **QBAF Construction**: Arguments assembled into a Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework *(p.2)*
5. **DF-QuAD Evaluation**: Gradual semantics computes final strength for the claim *(p.2)*
6. **Verdict**: Final strength > 0.5 → True; ≤ 0.5 → False *(p.2)*

### Prompt Variations (p.10-13)

Four argument generation strategies tested:
- **Direct questioning**: Simply ask whether the claim is true/false *(p.10)*
- **Direct questioning on confidence**: Ask for confidence level *(p.10)*
- **Chain-of-Thought**: Multi-step reasoning before verdict *(p.10)*
- **Role-player prompts**: LLM acts as debater/analyst generating arguments *(p.11-12)*
  - **ChatGPT prompt**: Generate arguments pro/con with strength attribution *(p.11-12)*
  - **OPRO prompt**: Optimization-style prompting *(p.12-13)*
  - **Analyst prompt**: Analytical role, evaluating validity and strength *(p.12)*
  - **Debater prompt**: Adversarial debate-style, argue both sides *(p.12)*

### Argument Strength Attribution Prompts (p.10-11)
- For the QBAF, each argument needs a strength in [0,1]
- The **Argument Strength Attribution** prompt asks the LLM to rate confidence that each argument is correct, accurate, and truthful on a scale from 0% to 100% *(p.10-11, Figure 11)*
- The **OPRO Uncertainty Estimator** prompt uses a numeric scale between 0 and 1 *(p.13, Figure 17)*

## Key Equations

### Claim Verification (Binary)
$$
v(c, \sigma) \in \{0, 1\}
$$
Where: v is the verification function, c is the claim, σ is the context. v(c,σ)=1 denotes the claim is true, v(c,σ)=0 denotes the claim is false.
*(p.2)*

### Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework (QBAF)
$$
Q = \langle \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{R}^-, \mathcal{R}^+, \tau \rangle
$$
Where:
- A is a set of arguments
- R⁻ ⊆ A × A is the attack relation (binary)
- R⁺ ⊆ A × A is the support relation (binary)
- τ : A → [0,1] is the base score function assigning initial strength to each argument
*(p.2-3)*

### DF-QuAD Gradual Semantics
$$
\sigma(a) = f_{agg}(\tau(a), f_{comb}(v_a^+, v_a^-))
$$
Where:
- σ(a) is the final (dialectical) strength of argument a
- τ(a) is the base score of a
- v_a⁺ is the multiset of strengths of supporters of a
- v_a⁻ is the multiset of strengths of attackers of a
- f_comb combines supporter and attacker strengths
- f_agg aggregates base score with combined attack/support influence
*(p.3)*

### DF-QuAD Aggregation Function
$$
f_{agg}(\tau(a), v) = \begin{cases} \tau(a) + v \cdot (1 - \tau(a)) & \text{if } v \geq 0 \\ \tau(a) + v \cdot \tau(a) & \text{if } v < 0 \end{cases}
$$
Where:
- τ(a) is the base score
- v is the combined influence from attackers and supporters
- When v ≥ 0 (net support), strength increases toward 1 proportionally to remaining headroom (1 - τ(a))
- When v < 0 (net attack), strength decreases toward 0 proportionally to current strength τ(a)
*(p.3)*

### Base Score Compatibility (Figure 6, p.7)
$$
\sigma_a = \sigma_b + \epsilon \Rightarrow \sigma_c' = \sigma_c + \delta
$$
The paper shows that modifying a base score monotonically propagates through the QBAF. Increasing base score of a supporter increases the final score; increasing base score of an attacker decreases it.
*(p.7)*

## Implementation Details

### QBAF Construction from LLM Output (p.2-3, p.5)
- The claim is the **root argument** (topic) of the QBAF
- LLM generates supporting arguments (R⁺ edges to claim) and attacking arguments (R⁻ edges to claim) *(p.2)*
- Each argument can recursively have its own supporters and attackers at depth D *(p.5)*
- At depth D=1: arguments directly support/attack the claim
- At depth D=2: sub-arguments support/attack depth-1 arguments
- The QBAF is acyclic (tree structure rooted at the claim) *(p.3, noted as most common form)*

### Base Score Assignment Strategies (p.5)
Three approaches for the base score of the claim and arguments:
1. **0.5 Base + Arg**: Claim base score fixed at 0.5, argument strengths from LLM *(p.5)*
2. **Estimated Base + Arg**: Claim base score estimated by LLM (via direct/CoT prompt), argument strengths from LLM *(p.5)*
3. **Estimated Base Only (baseline)**: Only the claim's base score is estimated, no argumentation *(p.5)*

### Uncertainty Estimation Methods (p.5)
- LLM is prompted to output a confidence score as a percentage or decimal
- This confidence directly becomes τ(a) for the argument
- For "Estimated Base" variants, a separate prompt estimates the claim's own base score

### Prompt for Argument Strength Attribution (p.10-11, Figure 11)
- Asks LLM to rate confidence that the argument is correct, accurate, and truthful
- Scale: 0% to 100%
- This becomes the base score τ(a) for that argument in the QBAF
- **Important**: The prompt asks specifically for "confidence" not for "strength of attack/support" -- the semantic meaning is correctness confidence

### Prompt for Argument Generation (p.10, Figures 8-9)
- Direct questioning prompt shows claim + context, asks if true/false
- For argumentation: asks LLM to generate supporting AND attacking arguments
- Chain-of-Thought: adds "Take a deep breath and come up with arguments step by step"

### MoClaim Template (p.13)
- For the MoClaim dataset: includes contextual information
- Template: "Consider the following background information: [information]. Given the background information the following is correct: [claim]"

## Results Summary

### Main Results (Table 1, p.5; Table 2, p.11)
- Tested on TruthfulQA and StrategyQA datasets *(p.5)*
- Models: Mixtral (various quantizations), GPT-3.5-turbo *(p.5)*
- **Best performing combination**: "Estimated Base + Arg" with analyst uncertainty estimator on Mixtral, achieving up to 0.675 accuracy (TruthfulQA) and 0.795 (TruthfulQA depth 1) *(p.5-6)*
- ArgLLMs generally competitive with baselines; argumentation doesn't hurt performance and provides explainability *(p.5)*
- **Key finding**: Using LLM-estimated base scores ("Estimated Base + Arg") generally outperforms fixed 0.5 base scores *(p.5)*
- The estimated base score alone (no argumentation) is often competitive, suggesting the LLM's initial confidence is informative *(p.5-6)*
- **Role-player prompts**: Analyst and debater roles sometimes outperform ChatGPT-style prompts (Tables 4-7, p.14) *(p.14)*

### Performance on Smaller Models (Tables 8-16, p.15-16)
- Mistral (smaller than Mixtral) shows similar patterns but lower absolute performance
- Argumentation helps more when the base model is weaker *(p.15-16)*

## Limitations
- ArgLLMs' added value over base score alone does not lead to a corresponding predictive variance in the task of claim verification in comparison to state-of-the-art methods *(p.7)*
- The method relies on LLM-generated arguments which may be fabricated or hallucinated *(p.6)*
- Acyclic QBAFs only (trees) — does not handle cyclic argumentation graphs *(p.3)*
- Binary verdict only (True/False at 0.5 threshold) — no graded output *(p.2)*
- The "semantic uncertainty" method is not integrated — only sampling-based approaches tested *(p.7)*
- Performance varies significantly across prompt strategies and models *(p.5-6)*

## Arguments Against Prior Work
- **Direct LLM verdicts lack explainability**: Users cannot see why the LLM reached a conclusion, cannot identify which knowledge was used *(p.0)*
- **NLI-based approaches** (e.g., stance detection) operate as black boxes without structured reasoning *(p.2)*
- **Prior argumentation work** (Freedman et al. 2024, earlier approaches) trained extra models to measure argument strengths and final output, relying on external trained models rather than LLM self-assessment *(p.2)*
- **Chain-of-Thought** provides explanations but they are not structured, not formally grounded, and not contestable *(p.2)*

## Design Rationale
- **Why QBAFs over Dung AFs**: QBAFs support graded strengths (base scores in [0,1]) which naturally map to LLM confidence levels. Dung AFs are binary (attack only, no strengths). QBAFs also support both attack and support relations. *(p.2-3)*
- **Why DF-QuAD**: It is the most commonly used gradual semantics for QBAFs. It satisfies desirable properties: base score monotonicity and argument relation contestability (formally proven in the paper). *(p.3, p.6-7)*
- **Why tree-structured QBAFs**: Simplifies the framework (acyclic, no cycles to resolve), and the LLM naturally generates tree-structured arguments (claim → arguments → sub-arguments). *(p.3)*
- **Why LLM self-assessment for base scores**: Avoids training separate models for strength estimation. The LLM that generates the argument also rates its confidence. *(p.5)*
- **Alternatives rejected**: Using external NLI models for strength (used in prior work but adds complexity), training argument quality classifiers (data-intensive). *(p.2)*

## Testable Properties

### Property 1: Base Score Monotonicity (p.6-7, p.17)
A gradual semantics σ satisfies base score monotonicity if for any QBAF Q = ⟨A, R⁻, R⁺, τ⟩ with A' ⊆ A:
- R⁻ₐ = R⁺ₐ = ∅ and τ' ≠ τ s.t. τ'(a) ≥ τ(a):
  - If a ∈ R⁺(c), then σ'(c) ≥ σ(c) (increasing supporter base score increases claim strength) *(p.6)*
  - If a ∈ R⁻(c), then σ'(c) ≤ σ(c) (increasing attacker base score decreases claim strength) *(p.6)*

### Property 2: Argument Relation Contestability (p.7, p.17)
A gradual semantics σ satisfies argument relation contestability if for any QBAF Q and Q' that differ only in that an argument a is moved from R⁺ to R⁻ (or vice versa):
- Moving a from support to attack: σ'(c) ≤ σ(c) *(p.7)*
- Moving a from attack to support: σ'(c) ≥ σ(c) *(p.7)*

### Property 3: Strong Base Score Contestability (p.17)
If a supporter's base score is increased, the claim's final score increases. Formally proven for DF-QuAD. *(p.17)*

### Property 4: Strong Argument Relation Contestability (p.17)
Moving an argument from support to attack (or vice versa) changes the final score in the expected direction, proven for DF-QuAD and QEM. *(p.17)*

### Proposition 3: DF-QuAD and QEM satisfy base score monotonicity (p.18)
Formally proven. Key property: if only the base score of a leaf argument changes, the propagated score changes monotonically. *(p.18)*

### Implementable Tests
- Increasing any argument's base score τ(a) must monotonically change σ(root) in the expected direction *(p.6)*
- Removing a supporter must decrease σ(root); removing an attacker must increase σ(root) *(p.6)*
- DF-QuAD output must be in [0,1] for all inputs in [0,1] *(p.3)*
- For a claim with no arguments: σ(claim) = τ(claim) *(p.3)*
- The aggregation function is bounded: f_agg(τ, v) ∈ [0,1] when τ ∈ [0,1] and v ∈ [-1,1] *(p.3)*

## Contestability Mechanism (p.6-7)

### How Contestability Works
Another unique feature of ArgLLMs is contestability. The system allows external agents (humans) to:

1. **Override base scores**: Change τ(a) for any argument a. The change propagates through DF-QuAD to the claim's final score. *(p.6)*
2. **Add/remove arguments**: Add new supporting or attacking arguments, or remove existing ones. *(p.6)*
3. **Change argument relations**: Move an argument from R⁺ to R⁻ (support to attack) or vice versa. *(p.6-7)*

### Two Notions of Contestability (p.6)
1. **Base score contestability**: Every time a supporter is present, an attack increases the attacker's base score → claim strength decreases. Every time an attacker is present, a support increases the supporter's base score → claim strength increases. *(p.6)*
2. **Argument relation contestability**: Moving an argument from support to attack (or vice versa) changes the claim's final score in the expected direction. *(p.6-7)*

### Formal Properties (p.6-7)
- Property 1: Base score monotonicity — formally proven for DF-QuAD *(p.6)*
- Property 2: Argument relation contestability — formally proven for DF-QuAD *(p.7)*
- These ensure that human overrides have predictable, formally guaranteed effects on the output

### Example (Figure 3, p.5)
- Claim: "Birds are important to badminton"
- Originally classified as False (with an attacking argument about birds not being used)
- Human removes the attacking argument
- Result: Final prediction changes to True (the shuttlecock connection)
- Demonstrates contestability: human intervention formally changes the QBAF and the output follows

### Example (Figure 5, p.7)
- Additional supporting argument added by human
- Changes prediction from False to True
- Shows structural contestation (adding an argument, not just changing a score)

## Relevance to Project

### Direct Relevance to Propstore
This paper is highly relevant to propstore's need to bridge LLM outputs with formal argumentation:

1. **LLM confidence → base scores**: The paper shows exactly how LLM-generated confidence percentages become base scores τ(a) in QBAFs. This directly applies to propstore's need to convert NLI stance confidence into formal argumentation structures. *(p.5, p.10-11)*

2. **QBAFs as intermediate representation**: Between raw LLM output and formal reasoning. Propstore currently uses bare-float NLI — QBAFs would add structure, explainability, and contestability. *(p.2-3)*

3. **DF-QuAD for aggregation**: Instead of using raw NLI scores, propstore could use DF-QuAD to aggregate multiple evidence sources (claims supporting/attacking a stance) into a graded verdict. The aggregation function is simple, well-defined, and has proven monotonicity properties. *(p.3)*

4. **Contestability for propstore's non-commitment principle**: The formal contestability properties align with propstore's design principle of holding multiple rival normalizations without forcing one to be canonical. Users could override LLM-generated stances, and the formal framework guarantees the override propagates correctly. *(p.6-7)*

5. **QBAF → Dung AF bridge**: QBAFs generalize Dung AFs (a QBAF with τ(a) ∈ {0,1} and R⁺ = ∅ is a Dung AF). Propstore already has Dung AF infrastructure; QBAFs extend it with gradual strengths. *(p.3)*

6. **QBAF → ASPIC+ connection**: The paper notes QBAFs can be composed of components from ASPIC+ style argumentation. The structured arguments (premises → conclusion) naturally map to ASPIC+ strict/defeasible rules. *(p.2-3)*

### Implementation Path for Propstore
- Replace bare-float NLI scores with QBAF base scores
- Implement DF-QuAD aggregation (simple, ~20 lines of code)
- Structure claim-stance relationships as QBAF attack/support relations
- Allow user overrides via base score modification (contestability)
- Multiple render policies could use different semantics (DF-QuAD vs QEM vs others)

## Open Questions
- [ ] How to handle the case where LLM confidence is poorly calibrated (the paper acknowledges this but doesn't solve it)
- [ ] Can DF-QuAD work with cyclic QBAFs (needed if propstore has circular argument structures)?
- [ ] How to integrate with ATMS — can QBAF base scores map to assumption labels?
- [ ] The paper uses binary verdicts (>0.5 = True); propstore may need the graded σ(a) values directly
- [ ] How does argument depth D interact with computational cost? The paper only tests D=1 and D=2
- [ ] What is QEM (Quantitative Energy Model)? Referenced in proofs but not defined in the main paper
