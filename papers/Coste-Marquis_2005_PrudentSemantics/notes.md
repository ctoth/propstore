# Prudent Semantics for Argumentation Frameworks

## One-Sentence Summary
Introduces prudent variants of Dung extension semantics that forbid pairs of arguments from co-occurring in an extension when one indirectly attacks the other, yielding more cautious inference for controversial arguments without increasing the known complexity class of the corresponding Dung inference problems. *(p.1, p.4)*

## Problem Addressed
Dung semantics prevent direct conflict inside admissible extensions, but they can still infer together arguments that conflict indirectly. The paper's motivating example has `a` and `i` jointly accepted by all standard Dung semantics even though `i` indirectly attacks `a` and indirectly defends `a`; the authors call such behavior insufficiently cautious for set-level inference. *(p.1)*

## Key Contributions
- Defines p-admissible sets: admissible sets with no indirect conflicts. *(p.2)*
- Defines preferred p-extensions, stable p-extensions, grounded p-extensions, complete p-extensions, and prudent inference relations. *(p.2-p.3)*
- Proves every finite argumentation framework has at least one preferred p-extension and a unique grounded p-extension, but may have no stable p-extension. *(p.2-p.3)*
- Shows stable p-extensions are preferred p-extensions, but not conversely. *(p.2)*
- Proves the grounded p-extension is a complete p-extension. *(p.3)*
- Compares cautiousness relationships among prudent inference relations and between prudent and Dung inference relations. *(p.3-p.4)*
- States that deciding indirect attack, indirect-conflict-freeness, p-admissibility, stable p-extensionhood, and grounded p-extensionhood is in P; preferred p-extensionhood and universal stable p-acceptance are in coNP; existential preferred/stable p-acceptance is in NP; universal preferred p-acceptance is in `Pi_2^p`. *(p.4)*

## Study Design (empirical papers)

## Methodology
The paper is a formal theory paper in abstract argumentation. It starts from finite Dung argumentation frameworks `AF = <A, R>`, keeps Dung's acceptability and admissibility machinery, and strengthens the conflict-free side by ruling out odd-length directed paths between co-members of a candidate set. It then defines prudent analogues of preferred, stable, grounded, and complete extensions, studies existence and inclusion properties, compares induced inference relations by cautiousness, and maps decision-problem complexity back to known Dung-style classes. *(p.1-p.4)*

## Key Equations / Statistical Models

$$
AF = \langle A, R \rangle,\quad R \subseteq A \times A
$$

Where: `A` is a finite set of arguments and `R` is the attack relation. *(p.2)*

$$
a \text{ is acceptable w.r.t. } S \iff \forall b \in A,\ ((b,a) \in R \Rightarrow \exists c \in S,\ (c,b) \in R)
$$

Where: an attacker `b` of `a` must itself be attacked by some member `c` of `S`. *(p.2)*

$$
S \text{ is conflict-free} \iff \forall a,b \in S,\ (a,b) \notin R
$$

Where: direct attacks between members of `S` are disallowed. *(p.2)*

$$
\mathcal{F}_{AF}: 2^A \to 2^A,\quad
\mathcal{F}_{AF}(S)=\{a \mid a \text{ is acceptable w.r.t. } S\}
$$

Where: Dung's characteristic function maps a set to the arguments acceptable with respect to it. *(p.2)*

$$
S \text{ is p-admissible} \iff S \text{ is admissible and } \nexists a,b \in S \text{ such that an odd-length path leads from } a \text{ to } b
$$

Where: the odd-length path is in the argumentation framework's attack graph; such a path is an indirect attack and creates an indirect conflict. *(p.2)*

$$
\mathcal{F}^{p}_{AF}: 2^A \to 2^A,\quad
\mathcal{F}^{p}_{AF}(S)=\{a \mid a \text{ is acceptable w.r.t. } S \text{ and } S \cup \{a\} \text{ is without indirect conflict}\}
$$

Where: the prudent characteristic function admits only acceptable arguments whose addition preserves absence of indirect conflict. *(p.2)*

$$
\vdash^{q,s}_{p}
$$

Where: this denotes inference under prudent semantics `s`, with `s = P` for preferred, `s = S` for stable, `s = G` for grounded, and `q` either existential/credulous or universal/skeptical. *(p.3)*

## Methods & Implementation Details
- Model an argumentation framework as a finite directed graph `AF = <A, R>`. *(p.2)*
- Compute ordinary acceptability exactly as in Dung: every attacker of a candidate argument must be attacked by a member of the defending set. *(p.2)*
- Compute indirect attack by reachability through odd-length directed paths in the attack graph. *(p.1-p.2)*
- A p-admissible set must first be admissible and then pass an additional indirect-conflict check over all ordered pairs of members. *(p.2)*
- Preferred p-extensions are subset-maximal p-admissible sets. *(p.2)*
- Stable p-extensions are indirect-conflict-free sets that directly attack every argument outside the set. *(p.2)*
- The grounded p-extension is obtained by iterating `F^p_AF` from the empty set until the finite monotone sequence becomes stationary. *(p.3)*
- Complete p-extensions are p-admissible sets containing every argument acceptable with respect to the set that is also without indirect conflict with the set. *(p.3)*
- For stable-prudent inference, account explicitly for frameworks with no stable p-extension; the paper's comparison assumes stable p-extensions exist, otherwise stable prudent inference trivializes. *(p.3)*
- Complexity does not shift relative to the corresponding Dung inference relations for set-of-arguments queries: p-extension recognition and acceptance problems land in P, NP, coNP, or `Pi_2^p` as stated in the paper. *(p.4)*

## Figures of Interest
- **Example 1 graph (p.1):** Framework `AF_1` with `A = {a,b,c,e,n,i}` and `R = {(b,a),(c,a),(n,c),(i,b),(e,c),(i,e)}`. It illustrates why ordinary Dung semantics jointly infer `a` and `i` even though `i` is controversial with respect to `a`.
- **Cautiousness table for prudent inference relations (p.3):** Shows inclusion/equivalence/non-inclusion relationships among credulous and skeptical preferred/stable/grounded prudent inference relations when a stable p-extension exists.
- **Cautiousness table comparing prudent and Dung inference relations (p.4):** Shows prudent inference is generally more cautious than the corresponding Dung inference, with skeptical preferred prudent identified as especially cautious.

## Results Summary
In `AF_1`, Dung semantics all yield the single extension `{a,i,n}`, so `a` and `i` are jointly derivable even though `i` indirectly attacks and indirectly defends `a`. Under prudent semantics, `{i,n}` and its subsets are the p-admissible sets, `{i,n}` is the unique preferred p-extension and grounded p-extension, and `AF_1` has no stable p-extension; therefore `a` is not even credulously accepted under prudent semantics while it is skeptically accepted under Dung semantics. *(p.1-p.3)*

Every finite framework has a nonempty family of p-admissible subsets because the empty set is p-admissible, and every p-admissible set is included in at least one preferred p-extension. Consequently every finite framework has at least one preferred p-extension. *(p.2)*

Stable p-extensions imply preferred p-extensions, but preferred p-extensions need not be stable. The grounded p-extension is constructed from the stationary point of the monotone sequence starting at the empty set under `F^p_AF`; if the framework is acyclic, the grounded p-extension is nonempty. *(p.2-p.3)*

The grounded p-extension is complete, but unlike ordinary Dung semantics, it is not generally included in every preferred p-extension. Instead, if a stable p-extension exists, the intersection of all preferred p-extensions is included in the grounded p-extension. *(p.3)*

The authors identify skeptical preferred prudent inference as the most cautious relation in their comparison. They state that credulous prudent inference is strictly more cautious than credulous non-prudent inference, and that skeptical preferred prudent inference is strictly more cautious than skeptical preferred Dung inference. *(p.4)*

## Limitations
- Stable p-extensions need not exist, which complicates stable-prudent inference and forces the authors to assume stable p-extension existence for some cautiousness comparisons. *(p.2-p.3)*
- The paper defines semantics and complexity classes but does not provide concrete algorithms for computing prudent extensions; the conclusion names algorithm development as future work. *(p.4)*
- The paper focuses on finite abstract argumentation frameworks and does not address structured argument construction or preference handling. *(p.2)*

## Arguments Against Prior Work
- The authors argue that Dung's standard semantics are not cautious enough for set-level inference because they can accept together arguments that conflict through indirect attack. *(p.1)*
- They criticize approaches that treat odd-length and even-length cycles similarly for purposes of indirect conflicts; their rationale is that arguments in odd cycles attack themselves indirectly and can also be controversial with respect to other cycle members. *(p.2)*

## Design Rationale
- The key design choice is to preserve Dung's admissibility base while strengthening absence of conflict from direct conflict-freeness to absence of indirect conflict. This keeps self-defense while preventing jointly accepted controversial pairs. *(p.1-p.2)*
- Preferred p-extensions use subset-maximal p-admissibility to mirror Dung preferred semantics while enforcing prudent conflict restrictions. *(p.2)*
- Stable p-extensions require direct attacks on every outside argument, matching Dung stable semantics rather than using indirect attacks for stability. *(p.2)*
- Grounded p-extensions cannot be defined as the least fixed point of `F^p_AF` because `F^p_AF` is generally nonmonotonic over all subsets; restricting the iteration from the empty set gives a monotone sequence of p-admissible sets and a well-defined stationary result. *(p.3)*

## Testable Properties
- If `S` contains two arguments with an odd-length path from one to the other, `S` is not p-admissible. *(p.2)*
- Every p-admissible set is admissible, but not every admissible set is p-admissible. *(p.2)*
- Every finite argumentation framework has at least one preferred p-extension. *(p.2)*
- Every stable p-extension is a preferred p-extension; the converse does not hold. *(p.2)*
- The grounded p-extension is unique and is a complete p-extension. *(p.3)*
- If `AF` is acyclic, the grounded p-extension of `AF` is nonempty. *(p.3)*
- The grounded extension of Dung's semantics is included in the intersection of all complete extensions, but the grounded p-extension is not generally included in every preferred p-extension. *(p.3)*
- Deciding whether an argument indirectly attacks another argument is in P. *(p.4)*
- Deciding whether a set is free of indirect conflict, p-admissible, a stable p-extension, or the grounded p-extension is in P. *(p.4)*
- Deciding whether a set is a preferred p-extension, or included in all stable p-extensions, is in coNP. *(p.4)*
- Deciding whether a set is included in some preferred p-extension or stable p-extension is in NP. *(p.4)*
- Deciding whether a set is included in all preferred p-extensions is in `Pi_2^p`. *(p.4)*

## Relevance to Project
This paper is directly relevant to propstore's argumentation layer because it formalizes an acceptance policy that rules out co-acceptance of indirectly conflicting claims. For a claim graph, the implementation consequence is that direct Dung conflict-freeness may be too weak when attacks encode contradiction chains: prudent semantics require an odd-path closure check before a candidate extension or accepted set is considered coherent. *(p.1-p.4)*

## Open Questions
- [ ] Which propstore render policies should expose prudent semantics rather than standard preferred/stable/grounded semantics? *(p.1-p.4)*
- [ ] Should indirect attack be computed as graph reachability over the current attack graph, or cached as an odd-path closure relation per revision/world? *(p.2)*
- [ ] How should propstore handle stable-prudent queries when no stable p-extension exists? *(p.2-p.3)*
- [ ] Can the grounded p-extension iteration be implemented incrementally as attacks and claims are added? *(p.3-p.4)*
