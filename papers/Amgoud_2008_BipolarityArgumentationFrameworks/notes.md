## One-Sentence Summary

A comprehensive survey showing that bipolarity (the coexistence of positive and negative entities) pervades all five steps of the argumentation process, culminating in a formal abstract bipolar argumentation framework extending Dung's AF with a support relation.

## Problem Addressed

Standard argumentation frameworks (Dung 1995) model only one kind of interaction between arguments: attack/defeat. In practice, arguments also *support* each other, creating a bipolar structure. This paper systematically studies where and how bipolarity appears across the entire argumentation pipeline, using the Dubois-Prade nomenclature of three types of bipolarity. *(p.3)*

## Key Contributions

1. **Taxonomy of bipolarity in argumentation**: Identifies bipolarity at every level of the argumentation process (argument construction, interaction, valuation, selection, conclusion), classifying each by Dubois-Prade type *(p.3-4)*
2. **Abstract bipolar argumentation framework**: Formal definition of BAF = (A, R_def, R_sup) extending Dung's AF with a support relation *(p.10-11)*
3. **Gradual valuation for BAFs**: Local and global valuation functions that combine positive (support) and negative (defeat) information into a single value per argument *(p.15-17)*
4. **Acceptability semantics for BAFs**: Definitions of conflict-free, admissible, stable, and preferred extensions that account for the support relation, including the concept of "closure for R_sup" *(p.22-23)*
5. **Supported defeat**: A new notion of defeat that arises through support paths, enabling indirect attacks *(p.22)*

## Methodology

The paper uses a survey + formal framework approach:
- Reviews how bipolarity appears in existing argumentation literature across all process steps *(p.4)*
- Uses the Dubois-Prade taxonomy of bipolarity: Type 1 (uni-variate: single scale [-1,1]), Type 2 (bi-variate: two independent scales), Type 3 (heterogeneous: both features from different sources with consistency requirement) *(p.3)*
- Introduces formal definitions building on Dung's framework *(p.5)*
- Provides worked examples at each level *(p.6-8, 12-14)*

## Key Equations

**Local gradual valuation** (Definition 9, p.15-16):

$$v(A) = g(h_{def}(v(B_1), \ldots, v(B_n)), h_{sup}(v(C_1), \ldots, v(C_m)))$$

where $B_i$ are direct defeaters, $C_j$ are direct supporters, $h$ is an aggregation function, $g$ combines defeat and support values.

Instance 1: $\mathcal{H}_{def} = \mathcal{H}_{sup} = V = [-1,1]$, $h_{def} = h_{sup} = \max$, $g(x,y) = \frac{x-y}{2}$ *(p.16)*

Instance 2: $V = [-1,1]$, $\mathcal{H}_{def} = \mathcal{H}_{sup} = [0,\infty[$, $h(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = \sum \frac{x_i+1}{2}$, $g(x,y) = \frac{1}{1+y} - \frac{1}{1+x}$ *(p.16)*

**Supported defeat** (Definition 23, p.22):

A supported defeat is a path $A_1, \ldots, A_{n-1}, A_n$ ($n \geq 2$) such that $A_1, \ldots, A_{n-1}$ is in $R_{sup}$ and $A_{n-1}, A_n$ is in $R_{def}$. A homogeneous defeat path of length 1 is also a supported defeat.

**Conflict-free in bipolar AF** (Definition 25, p.23):

$S$ is conflict-free iff $\nexists A, B \in S$ such that $\{A\}$ defeats $B$ (where defeat includes supported defeat).

**Admissible in bipolar AF** (Definition 28, p.23):

$S$ is admissible iff $S$ is conflict-free, closed for $R_{sup}$, and defends all its elements.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Source |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| $\alpha$ | Minimal value for defeat/support (no defeat/support = $\alpha$) | p.16 |
| $\beta$ | Maximal value for defeat/support (infinity of defeaters/supporters = $\beta$) | p.16 |
| $V$ | Valuation scale (interval of reals) | p.15 |
| $h_{def}, h_{sup}$ | Aggregation functions for defeat/support branch values | p.15 |
| $g$ | Combination function merging defeat and support scores | p.15 |

## Implementation Details

- The BAF is a triple $(A, R_{def}, R_{sup})$ where $R_{def}$ and $R_{sup}$ are binary relations on arguments *(p.10)*
- Support relation is independent of the defeat relation; both are built separately *(p.14)*
- The notion of "closure for $R_{sup}$" is critical for admissibility: if an argument $A$ is in an admissible set and $B$ supports $A$, then $B$ must also be in the set *(p.23)*
- Supported defeat creates new attack paths: a support chain ending in a defeat counts as a defeat *(p.22)*
- For desire-handling systems, a desire $d$ is unachievable if every complete plan is conflict-free but not supported *(p.22)*
- Three classes of arguments in selection: acceptable, rejected, in abeyance *(p.19, 24)*

## Results Summary

The paper demonstrates that bipolarity:
- At the **argument level** (Section 3): is Type 2 (bi-variate) with exclusivity *(p.8)*
- At the **interaction level** (Section 4): is at least Type 3 (heterogeneous), sometimes Type 2 when both relations computed from same data *(p.14)*
- At the **valuation level** (Section 5): local = Type 2, global = Type 3 *(p.18-19)*
- At the **selection level** (Section 6): is Type 2 with exclusivity *(p.24)*

The summary table *(p.26)* shows exclusivity always holds, duality sometimes holds, exhaustivity generally does not hold, and the two kinds of information are not always computed from the same data or with the same process.

## Limitations

- The support relation defined here ("explanation support" or "conclusion support") is only one possible notion; other notions like deductive support or necessary support are not covered *(p.12)*
- The framework assumes the bipolar graph is acyclic for the valuation step *(p.15)*
- The paper is primarily a survey and framework definition; no computational complexity analysis is provided
- No algorithmic implementations are discussed for computing extensions in BAFs
- The connection between the gradual valuation approach and the extension-based approach is not fully developed *(p.25)*

## Arguments Against Prior Work

- Standard Dung frameworks only consider defeat, missing the support dimension that exists in real argumentation *(p.3)*
- Previous work on bipolar argumentation (Cayrol & Lagasquie-Schiex 2005) focused on specific semantics; this paper provides the comprehensive survey *(p.4)*
- Verheij's approach [Ver02] defines conflict differently (two arguments in conflict about a third); this paper notes it as an alternative *(p.23, footnote 22)*

## Design Rationale

- Bipolarity is not optional decoration but a fundamental feature of argumentation that appears at every level *(p.25)*
- The Dubois-Prade taxonomy provides a principled classification rather than ad hoc categories *(p.3)*
- Exclusivity constraint (cannot simultaneously support and defeat the same argument) is essential for rational reasoning *(p.14, footnote 8)*
- Closure for support in admissibility ensures that accepted arguments have their support base also accepted *(p.23)*

## Testable Properties

1. **Exclusivity**: In a BAF, if $A R_{sup} B$ then $\neg(A R_{def} B)$ and vice versa *(p.14)*
2. **Supported defeat transitivity**: If A supports B and B defeats C, then A "supported-defeats" C *(p.22)*
3. **Admissible sets must be closed for R_sup**: If $A \in S$ (admissible) and $B R_{sup} A$, check $B \in S$ *(p.23)*
4. **Local valuation monotonicity**: Adding a defeater decreases value; adding a supporter increases value *(p.15-16)*
5. **Conflict-free with supported defeat**: A set containing both an argument and its supported-defeater is not conflict-free *(p.23)*

## Relevance to Project

**High relevance.** This paper directly extends the bipolar argumentation support already partially implemented in propstore (per Cayrol 2005). Key implications:

- **Support relation formalization**: The BAF = (A, R_def, R_sup) triple maps directly to the existing AF construction in propstore, which already separates attacks and supports *(architecture layer 4)*
- **Supported defeat**: The notion that support chains create new defeat paths must be implemented in extension computation — a support path ending in a defeat counts as a defeat for conflict-free checking
- **Closure for R_sup in admissibility**: When computing admissible/preferred extensions in a BAF, the support closure requirement adds a constraint beyond standard Dung semantics
- **Gradual valuation**: The local/global valuation framework provides a principled way to compute argument strength in bipolar settings, complementing the existing Z3-based approach
- **Three types of bipolarity**: The Dubois-Prade taxonomy could inform how propstore classifies different kinds of bipolar relationships between claims

## Open Questions

1. How should the gradual valuation approach interact with the extension-based approach already implemented?
2. Should propstore implement supported defeat as a derived relation, or compute it on-the-fly during extension computation?
3. The paper mentions other notions of support (deductive, necessary) — which are most relevant for propstore's use case?
4. How does closure for R_sup interact with the ASPIC+ preference ordering already in the system?
