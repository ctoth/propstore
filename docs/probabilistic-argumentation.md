# Probabilistic Argumentation

Standard Dung AFs treat arguments and defeats as either present or absent. In practice, both may be uncertain: a claim's existence depends on evidence quality, and a defeat relationship may hold only with some probability. The PrAF subsystem extends Dung's framework with probabilistic argument and defeat existence, enabling reasoning under genuine uncertainty rather than forcing binary commitment.

The implementation follows Li et al. (2012), with opinions from Josang (2001) as the uncertainty carrier, component decomposition from Hunter & Thimm (2017), and gradual semantics from Freedman et al. (2025).

PrAF remains propstore-owned. It consumes finite Dung and bipolar kernels from
the external `argumentation` package, but its probabilities, opinions,
provenance-bearing relation rows, sampling policy, and projection from
propstore claim data are not part of the reusable formal kernel package.

## The PrAF model

A probabilistic argumentation framework PrAF = (A, P_A, D, P_D) extends a Dung AF with existence probabilities (Li et al. 2012, Def 2):

- **P_A** maps each argument to an existence probability. In propstore these are subjective logic opinions (Josang 2001), not bare floats. Default: `Opinion.dogmatic_true()` (the argument definitely exists).
- **P_D** maps each defeat relation to an existence probability, also as opinions. Derived from stance confidence, opinion columns, or defaulting to dogmatic true.
- **Sampling probability** uses the opinion expectation E(w) = b + a*u (Josang 2001, Def 6). This bridges the four-valued opinion algebra to a single probability for MC sampling.

The `ProbabilisticAF` dataclass (`propstore/praf/engine.py`) also carries support edges, primitive attack probabilities (when attacks and defeats differ due to preference filtering), base defeats before Cayrol closure, and provenance-bearing relation records.

A PrAF induces a distribution over deterministic sub-frameworks (DAFs). Each DAF is a standard Dung AF obtained by sampling which arguments and defeats exist. Acceptance probability for an argument is the weighted sum of its acceptance across all induced DAFs.

## Computation strategies

### Auto dispatch

The default strategy `"auto"` selects the best computation method based on framework characteristics (`propstore/praf/engine.py`):

```
All probabilities ~= 1.0?  -->  deterministic fallback
<= 13 arguments?           -->  exact enumeration
Has supports or separate   -->  Monte Carlo
  attack/defeat relations?
Low treewidth + DP on?     -->  tree decomposition DP (currently gated off)
Otherwise                  -->  Monte Carlo
```

Auto dispatch avoids MC overhead when the framework is small enough for exact computation, and falls back to deterministic Dung evaluation when all opinions are dogmatic.

### Deterministic fallback

When every P_A and P_D is dogmatic true (expectation = 1.0), the PrAF reduces to a standard Dung AF (Li et al. 2012, p.2). The system detects this and delegates directly to the Dung solver, avoiding sampling entirely. The result reports `strategy_used: "deterministic"`.

### Exact enumeration

For small frameworks (<= 13 arguments), brute-force enumeration over all inducible DAFs is tractable (Li et al. 2012, p.3-4, p.8). The procedure:

1. Enumerate all argument subsets (2^|A| possibilities)
2. For each argument subset, enumerate all attack/support configurations
3. Compute extensions for each induced DAF
4. Accumulate weighted acceptance probabilities

Complexity is O(2^(|A|+|D|)). The 13-argument threshold follows Li et al. (2012, p.8), where exact computation beats MC for small frameworks.

### Monte Carlo sampling

For larger frameworks, MC sampling estimates acceptance probabilities (Li et al. 2012, Algorithm 1, p.5):

1. **Sample a subgraph** (`propstore/praf/engine.py`): for each argument, include with probability E(P_A). For each edge where both endpoints survived, include with probability E(P_D). Apply Cayrol derived defeats from sampled supports and direct defeats.
2. **Compute extensions** on the sampled Dung AF.
3. **Record acceptance** for each argument in the extension.
4. **Repeat** until convergence.

**Agresti-Coull stopping** (Li et al. 2012, Eq. 5, p.7; Agresti & Coull 1998): rather than running a fixed number of samples, the sampler monitors confidence interval width and stops when all arguments have converged. The adjusted Wald interval:

- adjusted_n = n + z^2
- adjusted_p = (count + z^2/2) / adjusted_n
- ci_half = z * sqrt(adjusted_p * (1 - adjusted_p) / adjusted_n)

Convergence requires ci_half <= epsilon for every argument in the component. Minimum 30 samples before checking. Safety cap at 100,000 samples. Z-scores: 0.90 -> 1.645, 0.95 -> 1.960, 0.99 -> 2.576.

**Connected component decomposition** (Hunter & Thimm 2017, Prop 18): acceptance probability separates over connected components of the attack/support graph. Each component gets independent MC sampling (`propstore/praf/components.py` and `propstore/praf/engine.py`). Components where all probabilities are deterministic are short-circuited to exact Dung evaluation, avoiding unnecessary sampling.

### DF-QuAD gradual semantics

DF-QuAD (Freedman et al. 2025, p.3) computes continuous argument strengths in [0,1] rather than binary acceptance. Implemented in `propstore/praf/dfquad.py`.

The evaluation formula: sigma(a) = f_agg(tau(a), f_comb(v_a+, v_a-))

**Combination function** (`propstore/praf/dfquad.py:39`): aggregates influence from supporters and attackers using noisy-OR:

- support = 1 - product(1 - s for s in supporter_strengths)
- attack = 1 - product(1 - a for a in attacker_strengths)
- combined = support - attack

**Aggregation function** (`propstore/praf/dfquad.py:21`): combines base score with combined influence:

- If combined >= 0: base + combined * (1 - base) (push toward 1)
- If combined < 0: base + combined * base (push toward 0)

**Evaluation order**: topological sort via Kahn's algorithm for acyclic graphs. Cyclic arguments are handled by iterative fixpoint (max 100 iterations, convergence at 1e-9). Support edge weights act as multipliers on supporter strength.

**Two modes:**

- `dfquad_quad`: requires an explicit `tau` dict mapping each argument to an intrinsic strength. Only works with grounded semantics.
- `dfquad_baf`: uses neutral base score 0.5 for all arguments, treating the BAF structure alone as the source of differentiation.

### Tree decomposition DP

Per Popescu & Wallner (2024). Exact computation via tree decomposition dynamic programming. Delegates to `propstore/praf/treedecomp.py`.

Currently **gated off** in auto dispatch (`_public_exact_dp_enabled` returns False). The current implementation tracks full edge sets, giving O(2^|defeats| * 2^|args|) complexity -- no asymptotic improvement over brute force. Effective only for treewidth <= ~15. Only supports credulous argument acceptance over defeat-only frameworks.

The auto dispatch checks treewidth but will not select this strategy unless explicitly requested. The lower-level Python API still accepts `strategy="exact_dp"` for experimental use, but the public CLI does not expose it.

## COH constraint

The COH rationality constraint (Hunter & Thimm 2017, p.9) requires that for every attack (A, B), the existence probabilities satisfy P(A) + P(B) <= 1. Self-attacks imply P(A) <= 0.5. This prevents paradoxical situations where two mutually attacking arguments both exist with high probability.

`enforce_coh()` (`propstore/praf/engine.py`) applies iterative proportional scaling (up to 100 iterations): when a pair violates the constraint, both expectations are scaled proportionally so their sum equals 1.0. Opinions are rebuilt from adjusted expectations preserving evidence counts.

COH is opt-in. Apply it when your domain requires that mutual attackers cannot coexist with high probability. Skip it when argument existence is independently justified and you want the MC sampler to see the full probability space.

## Opinion integration

Opinions flow into PrAF from the stance and calibration layer:

1. **P_A (argument existence):** `p_arg_from_claim()` (`propstore/praf/engine.py`) returns `Opinion.dogmatic_true()` for all active claims. Per Li et al. (2012, p.2), arguments in the knowledge base exist with certainty.

2. **P_D (edge existence):** `p_relation_from_stance()` (`propstore/praf/engine.py`) extracts opinions from stance data through a fallback chain:
   - Full opinion columns (b, d, u, a) -> direct Opinion construction
   - Confidence float -> `from_probability(confidence, 1)` (moderate uncertainty)
   - No data -> `Opinion.dogmatic_true()` (backward compatibility)

3. **Construction from store:** `build_praf()` in `propstore/praf/projection.py` is the store-facing entrypoint. It is re-exported from `propstore.praf` and delegates to `build_praf_from_shared_input()` in `propstore/core/analyzers.py` to assemble the full `ProbabilisticAF` from relation maps and claim data.

The calibration layer (temperature scaling per Guo et al. 2017, evidence-to-opinion mapping per Sensoy et al. 2018) feeds into opinion construction upstream of PrAF. See `docs/argumentation.md` for details on the opinion algebra and calibration.

## Known limitations

- **P_A conflated with tau in DF-QuAD mode.** Li et al. (2012) define P_A as argument existence probability; Rago (2016) and Freedman et al. (2025) define tau as intrinsic argument strength. These are conceptually distinct but currently share the same value (`propstore/praf/engine.py`). This means DF-QuAD base scores are driven by existence probability rather than independent intrinsic strength.
- **Tree decomposition gated off.** The Popescu & Wallner (2024) DP backend exists but provides no asymptotic improvement in its current form. It remains disabled in auto dispatch.
- **Extension probability query limited to grounded semantics.** The MC extension probability loop computes P(grounded extension = queried set) but does not generalize to preferred or stable semantics.
- **P_A always dogmatic.** `p_arg_from_claim()` currently returns `Opinion.dogmatic_true()` for all claims. Variable argument existence would require evidence-count integration at the claim level.
