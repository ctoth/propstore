"""Typed provenance value objects for the semantic layer.

A :class:`Provenance` records *how* a probability-bearing or asserted value came
to be — its typed :class:`ProvenanceStatus` (``measured`` / ``calibrated`` /
``stated`` / ``defaulted`` / ``vacuous``), the witnesses that asserted it, and the
chain of operations that transformed it. The reference grounding is CLAUDE.md's
"honest ignorance over fabricated confidence": every value entering the
argumentation layer must say *where it came from* rather than fabricate a number.

Scope boundary (PLAN.md §12.0 / §12.4): provenance is carried OUT-OF-BAND and is
NEVER part of concept/lexical identity. The *physical* carrier — a git note on
``refs/notes/provenance`` — is a later phase (Phase 8); this module defines only
the in-memory provenance TYPE that the lemon value objects require. Identity is
computed by functions that exclude provenance (see
:func:`propstore.core.lemon.lexical_entry_identity_key`), so attaching provenance
to a sense or a qualia reference never changes what that entry *is*.

These are frozen ``msgspec.Struct`` value objects so they nest directly inside the
charter document tree (and therefore the sidecar JSON projection) with one
canonical spelling — there is no provenance DTO/payload mirror.
