"""DF-QuAD gradual semantics for Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks.

Implements the aggregation function from Freedman et al. (2025, p.3).
Computes continuous argument strengths in [0,1] by propagating base scores
through attack and support relations.

Per Freedman et al. (2025): QBAFs extend Dung AFs with graded base
strengths τ(a) ∈ [0,1] and explicit support relations R⁺, alongside
attack relations R⁻.
